                            Going to the hospital can be stressful. Patients and their loved ones might be worried about an illness, anxious about recovery times, or concerned about what a procedure will cost. Today more than ever, patients have a great number of choices to make about the type of medical care they receive. We know that patients need to have reliable and understandable information about the level of care our hospital provides in order to make the best decisions possible. <br><br>
                            we strive to ensure that the care we provide is:<br>

Safe: Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.<br>

Effective: Providing services based on scientific knowledge and best practice.<br>

Patient-centered: Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values, ensuring that patients' values guide all clinical decisions.<br>

Timely: Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and provide care.<br>

Efficient: Avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy.<br>

Equitable: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socio-economic status.<br>
